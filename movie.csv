As the music plays, the first contestant to name the song wins money and prizes. Additional challenges include the contestants 'bidding' on how few notes they need in order to name that tune. Two contestants competed in a series of musical identification games in this 1980s five-day-a-week update of ""Name That Tune."" Games included Melody Roulette, where host Lange spun a carnival wheel to determine the dollar value of the tune; Tune Topics, where each song's title was related; and the famous Bid-a-Note, where contestants were given the clue to a song and then bid downward against each other to determine how few notes they needed (""I can name that tune in three notes!""). Contestants won points for winning each round; the high scorer after three rounds was champion and moved on to the ""Golden Medley. In the ""Golden Medley,"" the champion had to identify seven tunes within 30 seconds. Prizes were awarded for each correct answer. An incorrect guess stopped the game, while naming all seven tunes won an additional prize package and the right to return for a tournament (which took place every eight weeks or so) for $100,000 in cash and prizes. Some of the prizes offered for the tournament winners were awarded individually to winners in a home- viewer contest."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

"""+27: Social Innovators of South Africa"" (2014)"	 If there's any country in the world that needs social entrepreneurs, it's South Africa. It has been two decades since the end of Apartheid and the dreams of 'Rainbow Nation' have begun to fade. The reality of leading a country out of dark times has proved a difficult task. Unemployment among the youth is high and crime, education, health care and housing shortages are big issues. However there is hope. Through 6 x 26-minute episodes +27: SOCIAL INNOVATORS OF SOUTH AFRICA tells the story of six social innovators - men and women who are crucial change-makers. They are passionate, community-centric activists who want to make a difference. Each episode focuses on one social entrepreneur and we get to know their personal history, what has motivated them, and the essence of how their project functions. We meet some of the individuals who help them and some of the people whose lives are being uplifted by their programs. With high production values, each episode of this documentary will also be shot by a different young director and crew. The way we make +27: SOCIAL INNOVATORS OF SOUTH AFRICA will therefore reflect the spirit and energy of the people we are documenting. Along with the 6 episodes there will also be a detailed behind-the-scenes series that will help to explain the landscape of the production and the upliftment ethos that underscores +27 as a whole.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Each episode offered 20 of those moments on a descending scale (i.e. 100-81, 80-61, etc.). Among the highlights, represented via film and video excerpts and eyewitness recollections, were the creation of MTV, Michael Jackson's ""Moonwalk,"" Britney Spears' first appearance on Star Search, the debuts of such musically oriented series as The Monkees and The Sonny and Cher Show, and even such celebrated disasters as Mariah Carey's ""strip meltdown"" on Total Request Live. The same list appeared both on VH1 and in the pages of TV Guide, though there were a few discrepancies in the rankings. For example, while VH1 had once rated the Beatles' American debut on The Ed Sullivan Show as the number one TV musical event of all time, TV Guide superseded this with Bill Clinton's saxophone solo on The Arsenio Hall Show. The VH1 version of 100 Moments That Rocked TV ran for five consecutive evenings, beginning January 13, 2003."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Cocks has successfully reintroduced 180 of these animals and plans to save 8,000 more over the next decade. ""My goal is to save enough habitat that we can have 8,000 orangutans protected in reserves that we are looking after. And that will secure the species. That's my goal. That's at least a decent way of spending one's life."" So can Leif Cocks and his jungle schools help to save the endangered species from extinction?"	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

"""12 O'Clock High"" (1964)"	" This series chronicles the adventures--in the air and on the ground--of the men of the 918th Bombardment Group of the U.S. Eighth Air Force. First commanded by irascible General Frank Savage--and later by Colonel Joe Gallagher, the son of a Pentagon General--the Group is stationed in England, and flies long-range bombing missions into German-held Europe. This story is based not-to-loosely upon the real experiences of the crew of Frenesi, captained by William ""Pappy"" Cely, flying out of Rougham Field, Bury St Andrews. Though the sketch in general is a composite of any B-17's crew at the time, there are unarguable parallels to the Frenesi story, specifically, the mission to Brunswick on 2/11/44. Cely and his crew flew an inordinate number of missions; more certainly than the required 25. Cely flew Frenesi and her crew on this critical mission to bomb a ball bearing factory in Brunswick this day. The formation received heavier than usual flak and suffered gravely. Upon approaching target, dense, but intermittent low fog made dispatch questionable and the SOP would have been let fly and high tail it, but Pappy opted for a go-round, and re-approach to minimize collaterals. There was a school, see. Well Frenesi took a lot of heat; she was very badly damaged, but she was rewarded with a break in the fog to allow her to precisely dispense her load. She rattled back to Rougham, held together by her skin alone; her structure being later deemed ""the most heavily damaged bird to safely land"". She was a miracle, and Cely a saint."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Not only are Preston's forces badly outnumbered and out-gunned, but he is suffering from battle fatigue and on the verge of a breakdown.

The commander of the rocket factory that was the target of the raid decides to keep Temple and his cohorts at the facility to dissuade further attacks until he can relocate to a safer site. Because of the importance of the factory, Savage is forced to continue his plan to bomb on schedule, despite the risk to Temple. But thanks to some quick thinking by Temple, Savage is able to devise a risky tactic relying on pinpoint bombing that might spare the captives and still take out the target. General Crowe's order is that the factory at Laon be flattened if it takes every bomber on the base. All his information suggests the Germans may be making guidance systems for unmanned missiles there and they must be stopped. Savage resents the order because Laon has already cost him many men and planes, and it is with great reluctance that he puts his good friend, Major John Temple, on the next mission. Temple, flying his 25th and final mission, is shot down and he and four of his crew are captured and held at the factory as Nazi propaganda broadcaster Lord Haw Haw is given a message for Savage advising him not to bomb the factory lest he kill his own men. But to General Crowe the target is still critical and must be put out of business. Savage pleads for one chance to save his men: he thinks he can read on recon photos an effort by the American prisoners to point out which part of the vast factory complex houses the really critical operation. However, the German Commander at the factory saw the recon plane, knows the prisoners indicated the vital part of the factory and has moved all the equipment to another building.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

"""2point4 Children"" (1991)"	" 2point4 Children is a BBC television sitcom that was created and written by Andrew Marshall. It follows the lives of the Porters; a seemingly average family whose world is frequently turned upside-down, due to bad luck and bizarre occurrence. The show was originally broadcast on BBC One from 1991 to 1999, and ran for eight series, concluding with 30 December 1999 special episode, ""The Millennium Experience"". The September 2000 death from cancer of one of the lead actors, Gary Olsen, who played the father, ended the possibility of any subsequent specials. The show is now repeated regularly in the UK on Gold and Drama, and in Australia on UKTV. The title of the show refers to the once average size of a UK family. There are two children in the Porter family, however Andrew Marshall has indicated that the father, Ben, could be considered almost another child, making up the ""point four"". The show regularly picked up large audiences of up to 14 million in the early 1990s, with an average of between 6 and 9 million, the final episode was viewed by 9.03 million people."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But no one -- not the players, not the front office, not even the fans -- had as nightmarish a time as Wayne Doba. That season, the 33-year-old actor was selected to play the club's first mascot. The ""Crazy Crab"" was conceived as an anti- mascot. The Giants wanted to satire the late 1970s mascot craze, which had introduced now-iconic characters like the Philly Phanatic. So the Giants gave their Crab an intentionally shabby foam costume which looked like a hamburger with arms; during spring training, TV ads showed manager Frank Robinson attempting to strangle the Crab; at games, announcers would encourage fans to boo whenever the Crab took the field. It was an experiment unlike anything in professional sports. Doba became the Andy Kaufman of baseball. He mooned the crowd. He taunted his own players. The concept worked -- all too well. Fans did more than boo. They pelted Doba with everything from beer bottles and peanuts to golf balls, batteries, carrots and water- balloons filled with human poop. The Crazy Crab's career was short-lived. The character was unceremoniously axed in 1985. But Doba and his anti-mascot left such a lasting impression, it would be 17 years before the Giants would try introducing another mascot."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

For some, the team was heroic - made up of gritty, hard-nosed players who didn't back down from anyone. And for others, it was exactly that trait - the willingness to do seemingly anything to win - that made them the ""Bad Boys,"" the team fans loved to hate. No drama is complete without compelling characters, and the Bad Boys Pistons had a full cast. Viewers will see the many factors that drove one of the best - and most complex - players in NBA history: Isiah Thomas, a lethal combination of sweetness on the outside and toughness within. In addition, the team was characterized by the toughness of Bill Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn; the quiet intensity of Joe Dumars; the savvy and fearlessness of a young Dennis Rodman; the comic relief provided by John Salley; and the mixture of grit, professionalism and style possessed by coach Chuck Daly. Sandwiched between the Lakers' and Celtics' dominance of the 1980s and the Bulls' run in the 1990s, the Pistons' two titles in 1989 and '90 are often viewed as a transitional period in NBA history, rather than a dynamic championship era in its own right. But for anyone who experienced the Bad Boys in action, they more than carved out their own identity, both in the league and in American popular culture. Now, viewers will finally get the untold story behind one of the most unique championship teams in NBA history."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

In his junior year, he led Simeon High School to its first state championship. And that summer, he was named America's number-one high school basketball player by the nation's leading talent scouts. Then, on the eve of his senior season, the career of this exceptional youngster was abruptly and tragically cut short. Ben's grim fate sent ripples of horror through the city and the country.

By the time they have been retired for two years, 78% of former NFL players have gone bankrupt or are under financial stress. Sucked into bad investments, stalked by freeloaders, saddled with medical problems, and naturally prone to showing off, many pro athletes get shocked by harsh economic realities after years of living the high life. Drawing surprisingly vulnerable confessions from retired stars like Keith McCants, Bernie Kosar and Andre Rison, as well as Marvin Miller, the former executive director of the MLB Players Association, this fascinating documentary digs into the psychology of men whose competitive nature can carry them to victory on the field and ruin off it. Director Billy Corben (The U, Cocaine Cowboys, Limelight) paints a complex picture of the many forces that drain athletes' bank accounts, placing some of the blame on the culture at large while still holding these giants accountable for their own hubris. A story of the dark side of success, ""Broke,"" is an allegory for the financial woes haunting economies and individuals all over the world."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

It was tradition vs. swagger, the No. 4-ranked Fighting Irish versus the No. 1-ranked Hurricanes, one coaching star, Lou Holtz, versus another, Jimmy Johnson. But the name still attached to the contest came from a t-shirt manufactured by a few Notre Dame students: ""Catholics vs. Convicts."" In this 30 for 30 documentary, director and narrator Patrick Creadon (Wordplay, I.O.U.S.A.) doesn't just look back on the epic game. He explores the deeper narrative as a Notre Dame senior at the time, a close friend to the young men in the middle of the ""Catholics vs. Convicts"" controversy (Joe Fredrick and Pat Walsh) and a fellow classmate of the player behind center for the Fighting Irish (quarterback Tony Rice). The coaches and players open up about the fight that started the game, the highly debatable calls that are still being talked about and the insensitive aspects of the irresistibly popular t-shirt. As compelling as the tale of Notre Dame's dramatic victory is-even losing quarterback Steve Walsh calls it ""a helluva ballgame""-the backstory is just as riveting."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

On the eve of James Meredith becoming the first African-American to attend class at the University of Mississippi, the campus erupted into a night of rioting between those opposed to the integration of the school and those trying to enforce it. Before the rioting ended, the National Guard and Federal troops were called in to put an end to the violence and enforce Meredith's rights as an American citizen. Two people died and hundreds more were injured during the riots. Against this backdrop, the University of Mississippi football team was in the early stages of what would prove to be an unprecedented season in school history. Directed by Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Fritz Mitchell, ""Ghosts of Ole Miss"" explores the intersection of that football team with the Civil Rights history being made on campus. Told through the perspective of writer and Mississippi native Wright Thompson, the film explores the tumultuous events that not only continue to shape the state half a century later, but also led to his discovery of a personal family connection to the story."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Heading up a group that bought the New York Yankees in 1973 for $10 million, ""King George"" emphatically branded the world's most celebrated sports franchise as his own. The Boss has boasted 10 pennants, 6 World Series trophies and a corporate net worth more than $1 billion. But for all the glory and riches, the Steinbrenner legacy is also mixed with wasteful and embarrassing spending and countless episodes of tabloid-style soap. Now with George's health seriously failing, the Steinbrenner heirs are finally beginning to emerge from their father's larger-than-life shadow as they collectively move his franchise into a new home and a new era. Love them or hate them, the Yankees remain the most glorified team in American sports history. Led by the Babe, the Iron Horse, the Yankee Clipper and the Mick, they dominated baseball for more than four decades before the legendary franchise sagged under the ownership of CBS. Then in 1973, a 42-year-old shipbuilder named George Steinbrenner, a man now as iconic to his team as the pinstripes on its uniforms, headed a group that purchased the Yankees, and turned that investment into a billion-dollar business. Since 1923, the 'House that Ruth Built' has been the epicenter of the baseball world, and its team the biggest sports attraction in the Big Apple, inspiring generations of fans to maintain loyalties through good times and bad. But with a deteriorating facility and an eye towards 21st century style revenues, Steinbrenner was inspired to build an impressive new stadium. While the Yankees kept their Bronx address at 161st and River Avenue, the new ballpark marked the end of one grand era with the hope of launching another. Two time Oscar-winning filmmaker Barbara Kopple will look at the New York Yankees as defined by George Steinbrenner's enduring legacy, and will tell a story of how a $10 million dollar investment changed the face of not only a storied franchise, but an entire sport."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Just weeks before the Olympics on January 6, 1994 at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Kerrigan was stunningly clubbed on the right knee by an unknown assailant and left wailing, ""Why, why, why?"" As the bizarre ""why"" mystery unraveled, it was revealed that Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, had plotted the attack with his misfit friends to literally eliminate Kerrigan from the competition. Now two decades later, The Price of Gold takes a fresh look at the worldwide spectacle that elevated the popularity of professional figure skating and has Harding still facing questions over what she knew when she knew it."	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Overwhelmed by riots and tensions, Miami was a city in flux, and the University of Miami football team served as a microcosm for this evolution. The image of the predominantly white university was forever changed when coach Howard Schnellenberger scoured some of the toughest ghettos in Florida to recruit mostly black players for his team. With a newly branded swagger, inspired and fueled by the quickly growing local Miami hip hop culture, these Hurricanes took on larger-than-life personalities and won four national titles between 1983 and 1991.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Born into a wealthy family, Richmond was the antithesis of the Southern, blue-collar, dirt-track racers who dominated NASCAR. He also was a flamboyant showman who basked in the attention of the media and fans - especially the attention of female admirers. Nevertheless, it was Richmond's on-track performances that ended up drawing comparisons to racing legends. And in 1986, when he won seven NASCAR races and finished third in the Winston Cup series points race, some believed he was on the verge of stardom. But soon his freewheeling lifestyle caught up to him. He unexpectedly withdrew from the NASCAR racing circuit, reportedly suffering from double pneumonia. In reality, the diagnosis was much more dire: He had AIDS. Richmond returned to the track in 1987, but he was gone from the sport by the next year as his health deteriorated. He spent his final days as a recluse, dying on Aug.13, 1989, at the age of 34. Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Rory Karpf will examine the life and tragic death of one of NASCAR's shooting stars.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

That means the thirty seven days elapsed between 28 June and 4 August 1914. The scenarios are the Foreign Office, the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose secretary was Sir Edward Grey series, and the German Chancellery in Berlin, so that the action is narrated by two young clerks who, after thirty-seven days, enlist in the armed forces . The miniseries is a mixture of drama and documentary, its tone is somewhat aseptically dry in which many details are simplified, but it highlights some aspects in order to answer the question that the viewer makes constantly: how we go from peace to war in just over a month? Though the series lop sides at a very British viewpoint and can't help to look at characters often caricatured, as Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Russian Tsar Nicholas II, the indecisive elderly Franz Joseph I, and the French Foreign Affairs Minister, Paul Cambon, it also balances a sense of levity avoiding to endorse the British character. Winston Churchill , First Lord of the Admiralty, the prime minister Herbert Asquith and David Lloyd George, Chancellor of the Exchequer or Treasury Minister, are not complimented. The series shows the struggle between pacifists and warmongers in the British Cabinet, as well as the growing opposition among military, led by Helmuth von Moltke, generalissimo of the German armies and civilian politicians, with Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg to the head. A dramatisation of the events that lead to World War 1, and, in particular, Britain's participation in the war.
